# Finances

This is the place where I publish small projects that are created during my exercises and practice.

I write my projects mostly in Jupyter Notebook, so please check the .ipnyb files.

In this section I am focusing on processing financial. I am using datasets mostly from Quandl and Yahoo Finance.

### [Commitment Of Traders](https://github.com/Ysbail/Finances/blob/master/Commitment_Of_Traders.ipynb)

This file contains an analysis of COT data for gold. On the chart I display long and short positions for selected groups and find correlations.

### [Visualizing SP_500, VIX, RUS2000](https://github.com/Ysbail/Finances/blob/master/sp500_vix_rus2000.ipynb)

After creating dataframes for S&P 500 Vix and Russell 2000, I visualize the relationship between S&P 500 and the volatility index (VIX) and the dependencies between S&P 500 and Russell 2000 Index.
