# Finances

This is the place where I publish small projects that are created during my exercises and practice.

I write my projects mostly in Jupyter Notebook, so please check the .ipnyb files.

In this section I am focusing on processing financial. I am using datasets mostly from Quandl and Yahoo Finance.

### [Commitment Of Traders](https://github.com/Ysbail/Finances/blob/master/Commitment_Of_Traders.ipynb)

This file contains an analysis of COT data for gold. On the chart I display long and short positions for selected groups and find correlations.

### [Visualizing SP_500, VIX, RUS2000](https://github.com/Ysbail/Finances/blob/master/sp500_vix_rus2000.ipynb)

After creating dataframes for S&P 500 Vix and Russell 2000, I visualize the relationship between S&P 500 and the volatility index (VIX) and the dependencies between S&P 500 and Russell 2000 Index.

### [Mixing Plots](https://github.com/Ysbail/Finances/blob/master/MSCI_PMI_HSI.ipynb)

This exercise is to compare time series data on one plot. In this notebook I am using data:
- MSCI index
- ISM PMI Index
- ^HSI Index

### [Divergence AMZN and S&P500](https://github.com/Ysbail/Finances/blob/master/divergence_amzn%26sp500.ipynb)

In this notebook I am checking out the divergence for Amazon vs Index S&P500. Mostly their correlation is very high but there are intervals that correlation is low and their divergences can be enormous.
